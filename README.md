# BinaryTree
binary tree with logical gates
1)	A customer needs you to implement a program that calculates a board of binary gates, that produces one value.
2)	The board accepts an array of 0,1 integers of the size 2^n.
3)	The target of the exercise is to implement a recursive algorithm, that calculates the result of the board effectively and correctly.
